(Next year the lifetime break is scheduled to drop to $1 million and the top rate to rise to 55%.)

The first is the love of self and the second, the love of money. Two Greek words, philautos and philargyros, succinctly express these concepts. Both, I detect, lie at the root of the world's problems. Certainly, this diagnosis is not novel. Why then are these destructive personality traits chronic in the human experience? Further, why are people who possess these attributes permitted to run rampant through communities and societies to the detriment of the greater population? The Protester seeks to curb the second phenomenon.

Though Maryland is the wealthiest state in the country, all Maryland's children are not equal. Maryland is not exempt from the conditions that allowed the Trayvon Martin tragedy to occur. Our battle for equity for all of our children is not just against individuals, it is against established systems and institutions. Child-wellbeing indicators show disparities from infancy to adulthood. See Advocates for Children and Youth at http://www.acy.org for more information. There are health disparities in infant mortality and low-birthweight babies. There are educational disparities in academic achievement and disparate administering of school discipline policies such as suspensions, expulsions, and school-based arrests. There are child welfare system disparities that show children of color being removed from home at higher rates than their white counterparts. There are juvenile justice system disparities at every stage from arrest to placement to youth being tried as adults.

It also doesn't report the wounding of troops who were attacked alongside those who were killed.

Then comes the defense, which has played outstanding all season and deserves much credit for those gaudy goalie stats. And not only do they protect the net, they produce.

Questionable Calls: Wilson was a major reach at the 48th overall selection as a safety with suspect range who wasn't much of a ball-hawk at Illinois.

A: I think it was absolutely right. What happened with King Crimson is that Ian McDonald and Mike Giles decided that they didn't want to go touring anymore. They decided they just wanted to make records in the studio. And so, they left King Crimson. That was it. The band was over. Now, we could have replaced two people, but I just didn't feel it was right. Ian and Mike were so important in that band. I said to Robert (Fripp) at the time, "I'll form a new band if you like. But I just don't feel right about carrying on the name King Crimson.
In accusing Adams of failing to live up to his commitment, Cogen cites a letter Adams sent in May 2009 to then-County Chairman Ted Wheeler.

Eurama cautions her against prizing the fabric over the person, a lesson that doesn't quite land, even when McKinley is swept into mourning at an indigo-tinged funeral when Eurama's husband dies. After this, McKinley continues to collect in weighty encounters successive fabrics, traveling along roads and through outposts that she notes were built for imperial extraction. McKinley's description of indigo's history, which often arises as overly deliberate exposition, is best when it appears like this, as it is — underfoot, in the air. Her most difficult procurement comes in the middle of an attempted coup in the Ivory Coast, where she sees herself mirrored in an upper-class African woman carrying, amid chaos over control of wealth, a Chanel purse: "I'm just like her; I'm unable to give up the ghost of the things I hope will fill me with meaning."

TRENTON — A city resident convicted of sexually assaulting his girlfriend’s two little girls was sentenced to 34 years in prison Thursday.
Santorum didn’t. He overthought. He overcorrected. He overdid. He spent so much time explaining the process by which he voted for this, or why he’d originally done that, and the difficulty in his position that led him to do the other, that he never made a positive case for himself.
For the rest of the runners, though, the race was a chance to dress up, join with thousands of friends, old and new, and spend a morning of revelry sweating shoulder-to-shoulder on the city pavement.

Mr. Malouf, who is on his third heart (his first transplant was in 1989 and what he hopes was his last in 2003), says more changes at Petersham are likely; he is working with existing kitchen staff and wants to hire people who are at least as good or better than he is to get through the transition.

But what's most amazing about "American Reunion" is its absolute lack of tonal control.

"The fact is," says Yuval Levin of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, "Medicare is going to crush the government, and if Republicans leave it unreformed then the debt picture is very, very ugly. They might never -- literally never -- show the budget reaching balance. Not in the 10-year window and not if they take their graphs out 100 years. Obama could probably show balance just past the budget window in the middle of the next decade because of the massive Medicare cuts he proposes, even if in practice they will never actually happen."

The same, of course, could be said of narrative, which is, at the most basic level, an attempt to impose order on the chaos of experience. That adds another layer of tension to the collection, since stories need some kind of resolution even when what they record is unresolved. For the most part, Doerr does an excellent job of balancing these intentions, creating work that is open-ended yet nuanced, avoiding false connections or epiphanies. The narrator of "The River Nemunas," a teenage girl who moves from Kansas to Lithuania to live with her grandfather after her parents die of cancer, learns that it never gets easier, that the pain of absence is perhaps the only thing that doesn't dissipate. "Lots of things fade away," she thinks, "but ghosts like these don't, heartbreak like this doesn't."

Strangely, the shift in the tight game came courtesy of two huge three-pointers by Holiday in the fourth quarter. With the Sixers leading, 74-73, and Holiday having made only six of 21 shots, the third-year guard rose from 27 feet with the confidence he always seems to have.

Like the two previous films about the CGI rodents with the helium singing voices, "Chipwrecked" falls well short of the bar for wink-wink postmodernism set by "Shrek." But it does make surprisingly inoffensive viewing for adults, who will find the semi-sly references to Sarah Palin and "You Got Served" a welcome distraction from the hackneyed plot, which sees the three Chipmunks and their girl-group counterparts, the Chipettes, marooned on a desert island complete with active volcano, hidden treasure and a savage native (a snarling honey badger).

With Ruvo as their host, Cosgrove, along with his wife, Anita, and a handful of other Clinic executives, found themselves as welcomed members of the Las Vegas scene at this year's gala -- it's a scene that Cosgrove succinctly summed up during the charity auction by saying, "It's not Cleveland, is it?"

When it works, though, it is a sight to behold. The Americans looked like a cat toying with a mouse for much of the first half of the final, reeling defenders in only to make the ball disappear with a deft flick or smooth pass to a teammate.

Asked whether he felt his team was ready for the game, Jones said: "I'd never say that I don't think anybody is ever not ready for a game. Everybody has their own style on how they play, and if they get ready or not. We just have to come out with more fire, especially in day games. I know we're all tired, probably didn't get that much sleep. The same goes for them. You have to come out ready to play and try to get yourself real hyped three hours before the game.

Detectives began re-interviewing witnesses after receiving a Jan. 4 Sun-Times request for all reports on the case.

When you look at the internal data on international tests you find a telling dichotomy regarding American scores. America has a disproportional number of students doing very, very well and a large portion doing poorly. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, which administers the PISA test, explains this dichotomy: the number of children in poverty. Twenty-two percent of American children live in mind-numbing poverty, which is far greater than the next highest country. Children do not learn well when they are hungry.

As New Orleans quarterback Drew Brees continues to close in on Dan Marino's single-season passing record, he is carrying his entire team along with him. Brees threw for 412 yards and five touchdowns Sunday in a 42-20 win over Minnesota, leading the Saints to their sixth win in a row. New Orleans had to overcome a sloppy start against Minnesota, including turning the ball over twice deep in its own territory in the first half, botching a surprise onside kick and having a 40-yard TD pass called back because of a penalty. But it mattered little to Brees and the red-hot Saints. Brees now has 4,780 passing yards this season, putting him 304 away from Marino's single-season record of 5,084 yards that he set in 1984. With two games to play, that leaves Brees needing to average just over 150 yards per game. It's hard to imagine Marino's record won't fall.
